# Stratus Stat Frontend (made distinct from "stat-services")

This is a fun weekend project currently hosted at https://stats.seth-phillips.com/, that pulls data ingested from [Stratus-Stat-Utilities](https://github.com/Siceth/Stratus-Stat-Utilities) and renders content to the interwebs.

Really the only things of interest here are the esoteric PHP routing and the graphing solutions. Bon App√©tit!


(Also, this is assumed to be an Apache/PHP setup.  Remember to `chmod -R u+rwX,go+rX,go-w /var/www/html` and `chown` accordingly!)
